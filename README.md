# Metropolis-Hastings Sampling

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for sampling from complex distributions. It includes scripts focusing on different types of distributions:
- `continuous_sampling.py` for continuous distributions.
- `discrete_sampling.py` for discrete distributions.
- `reports.md` contains detailed reports and findings from the implementations.
